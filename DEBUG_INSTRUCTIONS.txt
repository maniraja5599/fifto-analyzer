üß™ DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIFTO GENERATE CHART ISSUE
=======================================================

ISSUE: Generate Chart button not showing terminal output

SOLUTION: Added file-based debug logging

STEPS TO TEST:
==============

1. Start the Django server:
   Double-click: start_debug.bat
   OR run: python manage.py runserver 8000

2. Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. Click "Generate Chart" button

4. Check the debug log file:
   Location: C:\Users\manir\Desktop\debug_log.txt
   
   This file will contain detailed debug information showing:
   - When the view function is called
   - What form data is received
   - Step-by-step progress of the analysis
   - Any errors that occur

5. If the debug log file shows errors, we can fix them
   If the debug log file is empty, it means the form isn't submitting properly

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
=================

‚úÖ GOOD: Debug log shows:
   - "Generate Analysis View Called"
   - "Form data received"
   - "Calling utils.generate_analysis()"
   - "Analysis completed successfully"

‚ùå BAD: Debug log shows:
   - Error messages
   - Missing function calls
   - Empty file (form not submitting)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

If debug log is empty:
- Check if form action URL is correct
- Check if CSRF token is present
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

If debug log shows errors:
- We can fix the specific error based on the log

Let me know what you see in the debug log file!
